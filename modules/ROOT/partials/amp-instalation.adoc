== Adding the Plugin to the Xcode project

=== Manual Installation

To manually install the plugin you'll need to download our {amp-distribution}[latest distribution]. You will be using `{framework-name}.xcframework` and the `AmpCore.xcframework` to integrate this plugin.
ifdef::external-sdk-tvos-url[]

You will also need the {external-sdk-name} for {external-sdk-url}[iOS] and {external-sdk-tvos-url}[tvOS].

endif::external-sdk-tvos-url[]
ifndef::external-sdk-tvos-url[]

You will also need the {external-sdk-name} which you can download it on the {external-sdk-url}[release page].

endif::external-sdk-tvos-url[]
ifdef::not-tvos[]
NOTE: This plugin will only work on iOS.
endif::[]

ifdef::latest-ios-version,latest-tvos-version[]
NOTE: The latest version of the {external-sdk-name} used by this plugin is 
ifdef::latest-ios-version[{latest-ios-version}]
ifdef::latest-tvos-version[]
ifdef::latest-ios-version[ on iOS and]
{latest-tvos-version} on tvOS
endif::latest-tvos-version[]
, newer versions may be used, but you may run into unexpected errors until an update is released.
endif::latest-ios-version,latest-tvos-version[]

After aquiring the frameworks you can just drag them to you Xcode project directory.

The last step, is to mark every imported framework for `Embed & Sign` in the project's general tab.

=== CocoaPods

If you don't have CocoaPods installed, refer to the {cocoapods-docs}[CocoaPods documentation]. To use CocoaPods, first create a Podfile in the directory containing the Xcode project. For the {framework-name} plugin, the Podfile should look like this:

ifdef::external-sdk-podname[]
[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
ifdef::external-sdk-podsource[]
{external-sdk-podsource}
endif::external-sdk-podsource[]
target "ProjectName" do 

  use_frameworks!
  
  pod 'AmpCore'
  pod '{framework-name}'
  pod '{external-sdk-podname}'
  
end
----
endif::external-sdk-podname[]
ifndef::external-sdk-podname[]
[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
target "ProjectName" do 

  use_frameworks!
  
  pod 'AmpCore'
  pod '{framework-name}'
  
end
----
endif::external-sdk-podname[]

ifeval::[{not-embedded} == true]
NOTE: AmpCore is needed for the plugin to work, as well as {external-sdk-name} since they aren't embedded in the plugin.
endif::[]
ifeval::[{not-embedded} == false]
NOTE: AmpCore is needed for the plugin to work, since it isn't embedded in the plugin.
endif::[]


Once you have added the Podfile just run the command `pod install --repo-update` in the directory it's located. Once the command has been completed you should se a new `.xcworkspace` file in your folder. Now you can start integrating the library.
