= AmpCore

AmpCore is the main module for the Akamai Adaptive Media Player, it takes the AVPlayer and augments its functionality to provide proper event notifications, using a well defined and documented protocol stating what events exist and what they are all about. It also ships with a default UI. Akamai AMP can manage several different plugins, please refer to the menu on the left for a full list of the plugins.

If you desire to check out a basic implementation please refer to our application samples:

* {amp-sample-ios}[AMP Simple Sample for iOS].
* {amp-customui-sample-ios}[AMP Simple Sample for iOS with custom UI].
* {amp-sample-tvos}[AMP Simple Sample for tvOS].

== Adding AmpCore to the Xcode project

=== Manual Installation

To manually install AmpCore you'll need to download our {amp-distribution}[latest distribution] and look for the `AmpCore.xcframework`.

After acquiring the framework you can just drag it to you Xcode project directory.

The last step, is to mark every imported framework for `Embed & Sign` in the project's general tab.

=== CocoaPods

If you don't have CocoaPods installed, refer to the {cocoapods-docs}[CocoaPods documentation]. To use CocoaPods, first create a Podfile in the directory containing the Xcode project. For AmpCore, the Podfile should look like this:

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
target "ProjectName" do 

  use_frameworks!
   
  pod 'AmpCore'
  
end
----

Once you have added the Podfile just run the command `pod install --repo-update` in the directory it's located. Once the command has been completed you should se a new `.xcworkspace` file in your folder. Now you can start integrating the library.

== Implementation

Follow these steps to have a working implementation of the AmpPlayer:

=== Import

The first step is to import the AmpCore.

[source,swift]
----
import AmpCore
----

=== Instantiating the AMP player

To use AmpCore you should first initialize it. Add the AMP Player variable to your View Controller.
[source,swift]
----
let ampPlayer: AmpPlayer!
----

Use the AMP player variable to instantiate the player. At this point you also need to set its license.

[source,swift]
----
ampPlayer = AmpPlayer(parentView: parentView)
ampPlayer.setApiKey(YOUR_API_KEY)
----
IMPORTANT: A valid license is always required for AMP to play content. Licenses and trial licenses are provided by the Akamai AMP team.

=== Playing content

To enable playback, use the `play` method; by either passing the playback URL or the AVURLAsset as parameter.
[source,swift]
----
ampPlayer.play(url: YOUR_VIDEO_URL)

// or

ampPlayer.play(asset: AVURLAsset)
----
NOTE: The play method works for both Live and On Demand content.

==== Setting Autoplay

Autoplay can be enabled or disabled by setting the `autoplay` attribute to `true` or `false` respectively. The following code enables autoplay
[source,swift]
----
ampPlayer.autoplay = true
----

For more details on managing playback with AMP please refer to our xref:playback-management.adoc[Playback management documentation]

=== Listening to Events

To listen to AMP player events, make sure to implement the PlayerEventObserver protocol on your View Controller
[source,swift]
----
class ViewController: UIViewController, PlayerEventObserver {
----

Then, register the current class as the Observer
[source,swift]
----
ampPlayer.registerObserver(self)
----

Once registered the observer, the PlayerEventObserver callbacks will track the player events. 

Use `onBufferingStateChanged` to make decisions when the buffer changes its state. The possible states are:

* `.ready` when the buffer is ready and playback can start
* `.delayed` when the buffer is not full (player is still loading content)
* `.unknown` when loading has not started or there has been an error

The code below, for example, is an alternative for enabling autoplay by instructing AMP to start playback as soon as the buffer is ready.
[source,swift]
----
func onBufferingStateChanged(_ ampPlayer: AmpPlayer) {
    if ampPlayer.bufferingState == .ready {
        ampPlayer.play()
    }
}
----
CAUTION: Please notice the difference between `play(url: YOUR_VIDEO_URL)` and `play()` as the first is usted to set up the video resource to be played by AMP and the second to start video playback.

==== onPlaybackStateChanged image:callback3.jpeg[callback,70,70]

With `onPlaybackStateChanged` the decisions can be made based on the playback status instead. The possible states are:

* `.playing` when the content is being played.
* `.paused` when content is paused.
* `.stopped` when playback is stopped.
* `.ended` when playback has ended by reaching the end of the stream
* `.failed` when playback failed to start or there has been an error

NOTE: Please bear in mind that live streams do not have an end, therefore they will not transition to the `.ended` state. To handle the scenario where an end user exits live playback, use the `.stopped` playback state or the `WillStop` callback.

The following code will enable an infinite loop, by replaying content once playback has reached the end of the video.

[source,swift]
----
func onPlaybackStateChanged(_ ampPlayer: AmpPlayer) {
    if ampPlayer.playbackState == .ended {
        ampPlayer.replay()
    }
}
----

For a comprehensive list of Callbacks usable with the PlayerEventObserver, please refer to our xref:observer-callbacks.adoc[PlayerEventObserver Callbacks] page

=== Enabling DRM

To play DRM content, just provide the credentials for the content in a `FairplayConfiguration` object and load the stream with this configuration.

[source,swift]
----
let configuration = FairplayConfiguration(
    provider: .azure,
    serverURL: DRM_SERVER_URL,
    certificateUrl: DRM_CERTIFICATE_URL)

ampPlayer.play(url: YOUR_DRM_URL, configuration: configuration)
